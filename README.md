# Gaussian-Blur

## Introduction ##
A Gaussian blur is a 2-D convolution operator that is used to blur images in order to reduce detail and noise.

Technically, a Gaussian blur is represented as a matrix of weights, also called kernel or mask. The convolution is the process of adding each pixel of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the matrix.
